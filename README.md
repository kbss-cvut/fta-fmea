# FTA and FMEA tool backend

## Required Technologies

- JDK 17
- Gradle 8.4 or later
- Apache Maven 3.5.x or later

## Ontology Vocabulary

Vocabulary is generated by maven plugin located in `ontology-generator` subproject.
When ontology definition is changed, the sources need to be regenerated. 
For more details see [README.md](ontology-generator/README.md)

## Persistence

The data are mapped from Java objects to RDF entities via ontological mapping library JOPA and stored in a local GraphDB database.

The database URL needs to be configured in `application.yml`. The repository first needs to be created.  

## API Documentation

Authenticated users of the application can access: 
- Swagger UI at /swagger-ui.html (e.g. `http://localhost:9999/swagger-ui.html`)
- OpenAPI documentation for the API at `/v1/api-docs` (e.g `http://localhost:9999/v1/api-docs`)

## Health check

To check that the backend is running, use path `/actuator/health` (e.g. `http://localhost:9999/actuator/health`).
